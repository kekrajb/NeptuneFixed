Fluid Springboard for iOS 12 (Fixed for RootlessJB)

**Features**:

- Fluid app switcher.

- Lock screen quick toggles.

- Modern status bar **on all apps**

- iPhone X home indicator.

- More coming in the future :)

**Credits**: This is a fix of [Neptune](https://github.com/duraidabdul/Neptune)

###### Version
1.0 beta 4-1
###### Compatibility
Requires iOS 12.0 or later. Made for iPhone.

## Important Notes

- To take a screenshot, press the **power and volume up** buttons simultaneously.

- To access Siri, press and hold the **power** button.

- To shut down, press and hold the **power and volume down** buttons simulataneously.

## New Features

- Lock screen control center grabber is now enabled!

- Home screen app icons now fade out nicely when being deselected.

- Modern status bar on all apps

## Fixed Issues

- Fixed critical bug that caused Springboard to hang when Spotlight was accessed.

- Reworked corner radius rendering to avoid CPU overload, also invoked by the Spotlight bug.

## Known Issues

- The dock is not sized properly on the iPhone SE. This will be fixed in a future update. (Likely in a revised version of beta 4)

- Beta 4 has not been tested on iPhone 6, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone SE, and may have minor visual bugs.

Fixes are planned for all of these issues. No eta at the moment. If you find any issues, please report them in the "Issues" section, so that I can label them and track them!

A preference pane is in the works, so that I can offer the option to change the screenshot buttons and toggle the dock, home indicator and lock screen buttons. No eta. I am not expecting to have this done very soon, as I have exams coming up. In the meantime, there will be an alternate package up to disable the home indicator.
